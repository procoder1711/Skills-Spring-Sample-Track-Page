          Technology is a very amazing thing that scientists create. Scientists look at all the things that we as human beings will need in our lives, then make a cool gadget or object. For example, scientists knew that we needed a way to communicate with each other even when we are not together. Because of this, they created a telephone which we can use to talk to other people even when we are not with them.</strong>
